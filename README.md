# Simple Calculator
GUI Calculator Application which allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations (i.e. +, -, *, /).

# TODO:
Modify the UI and Kotlin code so that users can perform scientific computation 
and some graphing (much similar to a graphing calculator).

# Credits:
[Tensor Programming](https://github.com/tensor-programming) for helping me begin this project and a few others.
